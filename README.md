# Instructions for Upload

Please put the PDF files in the `slides` folder, named after the authors and year of publication. Make sure to use underscores instead of whitespace in the filename for easier references.

If the same author has multiple publications in the same year, add an additional serial after the year. Here's some examples.

    Chen_et_Manning_2013.pdf
    Hirsh_et_al_2018.pdf
    Hirsh_et_al_2018_2.pdf

Please also include the date of the presentation and paper title in this readme file. A DOI url to the paper would also be great.
